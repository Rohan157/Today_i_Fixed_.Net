# Problem
Azure Service Bus client can open upto 5000 concurrent connection and a single client. If you need to send/receive a large number of messages to/from service bus connection, you will get `ServiceBusException`


# Environment
Visual Studio 2022, .Net 6, C#, Azure Service Bus Client

# How you fix it
 In order to send more than 5000 message asyncronously, we need to create more instances of Service Bus client. This means that we need to change the scope of Service Registraiton in .Net Core `Startup.cs` file from `Singleton` to `Scoped`

# Solution
- Add Microsoft Windows API Code Pack Shell to you project using Nuget

- Use below c# code to write properties to the file

```
			  #region Service Bus
        
        builder.Services.AddScoped(new ServiceBusClient(//connectionString));
        builder.Services.TryAddScoped<IServiceBusMessageSender, ServiceBusMessageSender>();

        #endregion
